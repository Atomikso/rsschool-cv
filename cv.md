##About myself

_Recently I realized that I am not satisfied with my work, I want to develop.
A good friend of mine suggested that I learn Frontend.
I got acquainted with the video courses (the basics of HTML and CSS) and I was interested in it, I wanted to develop further.
On this course from rsschool I am for further development in Frontend development._
